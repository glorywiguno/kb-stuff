# Pesut40

Pesut40, acrylic case design that follows the latest open dyz40 plate design (at least at the time of writing).

Curve design on the side is inspired/derived from [Linworks Dolphin](https://www.lightningkeyboards.com/work-pt1/linworks-dolphin-v3) (photo from lightningkeyboards for reference).

## Hardwares
- 8x m2 6mm screws
- 4x m2 16mm spacer for the front case
- 4x m2 20mm spacer for the back case + feet.

Note: for the 20mm, might need a little bit of sanding down for the last part of feet if there's a gap.
