# Dohlice40

Dohlice40, acrylic case design that follows the latest open Synthesis40 plate design (at least at the time of writing).

Curve design on the side is inspired/derived from [Linworks Dolphin](https://www.lightningkeyboards.com/work-pt1/linworks-dolphin-v3) (photo from lightningkeyboards for reference).

## Hardwares
the case is designed around m2 screws
16 x 8mm m2 screws
4x 16mm m2 standoffs (can use 18 or 20mm, but 20mm sometimes might be slightly longer than needed)
4x 12mm m2 standoffs (can use 14, but 14mm sometimes might be slightly longer than needed)
