# RH-01
RH-01, short for 'Resin Hoarder no.01', is a 4x6 (1u slot) acrylic artisan case design.

## Other required parts
Generally you would need these parts:
- 8x 6mm M3 screws for the container
- 4x 20mm m3 spacer/standoff for the container
- 4x 10~15mm M3 screws for feet (if you make one with the feet)
- 4x M3 nuts for the feet
- (Alternative) 4x female-to-female M3 spacer/standoff
  and 4x male-to-female M3 spacer/standoff to connect the feet


## Recipes
For artisan around &lt; 18mm height
- 1x `00b-bottom-stand-flush-3mm`
- 1x `00a-bottom-stand-3mm`
- 1x `01a-bottom-flush-3mm`
- 2x `02-top-cell-3mm` 
- 4x `03-top-wall-3mm`
- 1x `04a-top-cover-open-3mm`
- 1x `04b-top-cover-3mm`
- 1x `05-feet-3mm`

If you have artisan with higher height, can add more `03-top-wall-3mm`
layers so that it can fit within the case.

If you dont need the feet, there's `01b-bottom-close-3mm` layer that can be used
in place of `00a-bottom-stand-3mm` layer so that the screws can hold the layer.


## Notes
- Layers with `flush` in its name rely on M3 hex 'socket head' screw size
  to stick on the case without any glue, but you can use glue or double tape
  as well. This layer is there just to make screws' head sit flush with the layer.
- the screw points for this case are symmetrical, so don't worry about assembling
  it in the wrong orientation
